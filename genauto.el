;; Quick start:
(defvar genauto-quick-start
"
Quick instructions:
In your .emacs.
(require 'genauto)
Then restart emacs (or eval the above statement). 
Then M-x genauto-doit.
Then add to emacs: (load \"~/emacs/loaddefs-my\")
"

  "Provides electric help for function `genauto-quick-start'."
  (interactive)
  (with-electric-help

;;; Introduction:
;; Stuff that gets posted to gnu.emacs.sources
;; as introduction
(defvar genauto-introduction
"

If you are a heavy emacs-user, you probably have more .el files
downloaded than came with emacs.  Plus you may have created tons of
your own function-definitions in various files...And you don't like to
\(require\) all of them in .emacs because that slows down the loading
of .emacs, right?  Genauto is a small utility that assists you in
generating autoload-definitions for those downloaded \(or for any
other\) files.

See also M-x genauto-quick-start. 

Please note that genauto MAY NOT work for Xemacs.  It uses the
function update-autoloads-from-directories, defined in emacs'
autoload.el, but \(perhaps\) not in Xemacs.  Patches are welcome. 


 Uwe Brauer might possibly be looking into porting genauto to Xemacs.  "
